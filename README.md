## About the Project

This project was developed for an introductory programming course at the **Faculty of Engineering, University of Buenos Aires (UBA)**, part of the **Software Engineering** degree. The course covers fundamental concepts of C programming, including arrays, functions, pointers, memory management, and control structures.

The game itself is a simple implementation of the Fifteen puzzle, where the goal is to arrange the numbered tiles into a specific order by sliding them within a 4x4 grid. The user can interact with the game through keyboard inputs ('w', 'a', 's', 'd' for movement) and try to solve the puzzle within a limited number of moves.

## Features

- 4x4 board with tiles numbered 1 to 15, and an empty space to slide tiles.
- Ability to shuffle the board randomly to create a solvable puzzle.
- A terminal-based user interface with controls for moving tiles.
- Difficulty levels with varying numbers of allowed moves: Easy, Medium, and Hard.

## How to Run

To run the game:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C source files using a C compiler, or use the provided `CMakeLists.txt` for building with CMake.
3. Run the compiled executable and enjoy the game!

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- Terminal-based user interface
